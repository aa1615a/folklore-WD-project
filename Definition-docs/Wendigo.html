			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>The Great Lakes Region</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>Basil Johnston, an Ojibwe teacher and scholar from Ontario, gives a description of a wendigo:
					<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
					"With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it had were tattered and bloody [....] Unclean and suffering from suppurations of the flesh, the Wendigo gave off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption." </blockquote>
				</p>

				<h4>Etymology</h4>
					<p><b>Alternate spellings</b> - Wiindigoo (the source of the English word, from the Ojibwe language), Weendigo, Windego, Wiindgoo, Windgo, Weendigo, and many others</p>
					<p>In Cree, its name translates to "evil that devous".</p>

			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p>The wendigo is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquian-speaking peoples, including the Ojibwe, the Saulteaux, the Cree, the Naskapi, and the Innu people. Although descriptions can vary somewhat, common to all these cultures is the view that the wendigo is a malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural being. They were strongly associated with the winter, the north, and coldness, as well as with famine and starvation. In the lore of certain tribes, wendigos are often described as giants, many times larger than human beings (a characteristic not present in this myth in other Algonquian cultures).</p>

				<p>Whenever a wendigo ate another person, it would grow in proportion to the meal it had just eaten, so that it could never be full. Therefore, wendigos are portrayed as simultaneously gluttonous and emaciated from starvation. The Wendigo is seen as the embodiment of gluttony, greed, and excess: never satisfied after killing and consuming one person, they are constantly searching for new victims.
				</p>

				<h4>The Taboo Reinforcement Ceremony</h4>
					<p>Among the Assiniboine, the Cree and the Ojibwe, a satirical ceremonial dance is sometimes performed during times of famine to reinforce the seriousness of the wendigo taboo. The ceremony, known as <i>wiindigookaanzhimowin</i>, was performed during times of famine, and involved wearing masks and dancing backwards around a drum. The last known wendigo ceremony conducted in the United States was at Lake Windigo of Star Island of Cass Lake, located within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota.

			<h3>Wendigo Psychosis</h3>
				<p>The legend lends its name to the controversial modern medical term Wendigo psychosis, described by psychiatrists as a culture-bound syndrome with symptoms such as an intense craving for human flesh and a fear of becoming a cannibal. In some Indigenous communities, environmental destruction and insatiable greed are also seen as a manifestation of Wendigo psychosis.</p>
