			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>Santa Fe River, New Mexico and other rivers around the southwest; The tale of La Llorana is present many in Latin American and Mexican cultures.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p> The ghost of a woman who lost her children and now cries while looking for them in the river, often causing misfortune to those who are near or hear her. She is often described as a very pale figure with long dark hair. She is wearing a white dress and is constantly crying. The name La Llorona translates to "the weeping woman."</p>
			
			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p> The basic story tells of a beautiful woman by the name of María who drowns her children in a river as a means of revenge towards her husband, who had left her for a younger woman. She drowns herself in the river when she realizes her children are dead.</p>

				<p>At the gates of heaven, she is challenged over the whereabouts of her children, and is not permitted to enter the afterlife until she has found them. María is forced to wander the Earth for all eternity, searching in vain for her drowned offspring. She constantly weeps, hence her name "La Llorona." She is caught between the living world and the spirit world.</p>
				<p>Mexican parents often use this story to prevent their children from wandering out at night. In some versions of this tale, La Llorona will kidnap wandering children who resemble her missing children. She asks them for forgiveness, then drowns the children to take the place of her own. People who claim to have seen her say she appears at night or in the late evening by rivers or lakes. Some believe those who hear the wails of La Llorona are marked for death but those who escape in time are not so marked, similar to the Gaelic banshee legend. She is said to cry, ¡Ay, mis hijos!, which means Oh, my children!</p>

				<h4>Skepticism</h4>
					<p>The legend of La Llorona persists in areas where mountain lions are active. The Audubon Field Guide to North American Mammals notes that the mountain lion's "blood curdling mating call has been likened to a woman's scream."This may be the original source of the legend, and may contribute to keeping the legend alive.</p>
