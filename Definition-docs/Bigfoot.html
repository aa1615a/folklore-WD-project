			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p> Strongly associated with the Pacific Northwest, in particularly Washington state and British Columbia</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>In American folklore, Bigfoot or Sasquatch is a hairy, upright-walking, ape-like being who leaves behind large footprints and reportedly dwells in the wilderness; roughly 6–9 feet (1.8–2.7 m), covered in hair described as black, dark brown, or dark reddish.</p>
			
			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p>Ecologist Robert Pyle argues that most cultures have accounts of human-like giants in their folk history, expressing a need for "some larger-than-life creature." Each language had its own name for the creature featured in the local version of such legends. Many names meant something along the lines of "wild man" or "hairy man", although other names described common actions that it was said to perform, such as eating clams or shaking trees.  Chief Mischelle of the Nlaka'pamux at Lytton, British Columbia told such a story to Charles Hill-Tout in 1898; he named the creature by a Salishan variant meaning "the benign-faced-one".</p>

				<h4>Sightings</h4>
					<p>About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America. Most reports are considered mistakes or hoaxes, even by those researchers who say that Bigfoot exists.</p>

					<p>The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s, and Bigfoot has been regarded as the first widely popularized example of pseudoscience in American culture.</p>

				<h4>Hoaxes</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>Jacko Affair (1884)</dt>
  						<dd>Author Jerome Clark argues that this was a hoax involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia. He cites research by John Green, who found that several contemporaneous British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as highly dubious, and notes that the Mainland Guardian of New Westminster, British Columbia wrote, "Absurdity is written on the face of it.”k</dd>
  						<dt>Rick Dyer Affair I (2008)</dt>
  						<dd> Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton posted a video to YouTube, claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern Georgia. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. as a good faith gesture. The story was covered by many major news networks, including BBC, CNN, ABC News, and Fox News. Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body was delivered in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team. When the contents were thawed, observers found that the hair was not real, the head was hollow, and the feet were rubber. Dyer and Whitton admitted that it was a hoax after being confronted by Steve Kulls, executive director of SquatchDetective.com</dd>
  						<dt>Rick Dyer Affair II (2014)</dt>
  						<dd>He released photos of the body and a video showing a few individuals' reactions to seeing it, but never released any of the tests or scans. He refused to disclose the test results or to provide biological samples. He said that the DNA results were done by an undisclosed lab and could not be matched to identify any known animal. Dyer said that he would reveal the body and tests on February 9, 2014 at a news conference, but he never made the test results available.
						On March 28, 2014, Dyer admitted on his Facebook page that his "Bigfoot corpse" was another hoax. He had paid Chris Russel of Twisted Toy Box to manufacture the prop, which he nicknamed "Hank". Dyer earned approximately $60,000 from the tour of this second fake Bigfoot corpse. He alleged did kill a Bigfoot, but did not take the real body on tour for fear that it would be stolen.</dd>
