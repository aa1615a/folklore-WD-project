			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>In the Cajun legends, the creature is said to prowl the swamps around Acadiana and Greater New Orleans, and possibly the fields or forests of the regions.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>The rougarou most often is described as a creature with a human body and the head of a wolf or dog, similar to the werewolf legends.</p>
				<div class="tab">
				<h4>Etymology</h4>
					<p><b>Alternate spellings</b> - roux-ga-roux, rugaroo, or rugaru</p>
					<p>Rougarou represents a variant pronunciation and spelling of the original French loup-garou. According to Barry Jean Ancelet, an academic expert on Cajun folklore and professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in America, the tale of the rougarou is a common legend across French Louisiana. Both words are used interchangeably in southern Louisiana. Some people call the monster rougarou; others refer to it as the loup-garou.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p>The rougarou legend has been spread for many generations, either directly from French settlers to Louisiana (New France) or via the French Canadian immigrants centuries ago. This legendary creature is linked to older European notions of the werewolf. Often the story-telling has been used to inspire fear and obedience. One such example is stories that have been told by elders to persuade Cajun children to behave.</p>

				<h4>Variations</h4>
					<p>One variation describes a wolf-like beast that will hunt down and kill Catholics who do not follow the rules of Lent. This coincides with the French Catholic loup-garou stories, according to which the method for turning into a werewolf is to break Lent seven years in a row.</p>

					<p>A common blood sucking legend says that the rougarou is under the spell for 101 days. After that time, the curse is transferred from person to person when the rougarou draws another human’s blood. During that day the creature returns to human form. Although acting sickly, the human refrains from telling others of the situation for fear of being killed.</p>

					<p>Other stories range from the rougarou as a rabbit to the rougarou being derived from witchcraft. In the latter claim, only a witch can make a rougarou—either by turning into a wolf herself, or by cursing others with lycanthropy.</p>
