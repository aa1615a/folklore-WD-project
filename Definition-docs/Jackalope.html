			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>Wyoming, South Dakota, and other western U.S. states</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>The jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore (a fearsome critter) described as a jackrabbit with antelope horns.  However, many jackalope taxidermy mounts, including the original, are made with deer antlers</p>

				<p>The word "jackalope" is a portmanteau of "jackrabbit" and "antelope", although the jackrabbit is not a rabbit, and the pronghorn is not an antelope.</p>

			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p>Folklorists see the jackalope as one of a group of fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days. These appear in tall tales about hodags, giant turtles, Bigfoot, and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like Moby-Dick. </p>

				<p>The jackalope is subject to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims embedded in tall tales about its habits. Jackalopes are said to be so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Also, they supposedly  mate only during lightning flashes. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk.[14] One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.
				</p>

				<p>Stories or descriptions of animal hybrids have appeared in many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a unicorn. In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria and elsewhere. Natural history texts and illustrations in the 16th and 17th centuries included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids as though they were real creatures, but by the end of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.</p>

				<p>The tales of the jackalope lend themselves to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.</p>

				<h4>The Douglas Variant</h4>
					<p>In the 1930s, Douglas Herrick and his brother, hunters with taxidermy skills, popularized the American jackalope by grafting deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass and selling the combination to a local hotel in Douglas, Wyoming. Thereafter, they made and sold many similar jackalopes to a retail outlet in South Dakota, and another taxidermist continues to manufacture the horned rabbits in the 21st century. </p>

					<p>Stuffed and mounted, jackalopes are found in many bars and other places in the United States; stores catering to tourists sell jackalope postcards and other paraphernalia, and commercial entities in America. The jackalope has appeared in published stories, poems, television shows, video games, and a low-budget mockumentary film. The Wyoming Legislature has considered bills to make the jackalope the state's official mythological creature.</p>

				<h4>Shope papilloma virus</h4>
					<p>The underlying legend of the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, may be related to similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that at least some of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the <i>Shope papilloma virus.</i> It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.</p>
