			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>Based upon reports of alligator sightings in rather unorthodox locations, in particular urban locations like New York City.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>Regular alligators that have grown much larger by eating waste in the sewer system.
					<p>Some depictions suggest that, after the alligator was disposed of at such a young age, it would live the majority of its life in an environment not exposed to sunlight. In time, it would lose its eyesight and the pigment in its hide so that the reptile would grow to be completely albino, pure white in color with red or pink eyes. Another reason why an albino alligator would retreat to an underground sewer is because of its vulnerability to the sun in the wild, as there is no dark pigment in the creature's skin, it has no protection from the sun, which makes it very hard for it to survive in the wild</p>

			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p>As late as the middle of the 20th century, souvenir shops in Florida sold live baby alligators (in small fish tanks) as novelty souvenirs. Tourists from New York City would buy a baby alligator and try to raise it as a pet. When the alligator grew too large for comfort, the family would proceed to flush the reptile down the toilet.
				<p>The most common story is that the alligators survive and reside within the sewer and reproduce, feeding on rats and rubbish, growing to huge sizes and striking fear into sewer workers. In Robert Daley's book The World Beneath the City (1959) he comments that one night a sewer worker in New York City was shocked to find a large albino alligator swimming toward him. Weeks of hunting followed.
				<p>Many have even questioned how accurate the original stories are, and some have even suggested they are fictions created by Teddy May, who was the Commissioner of Sewers at the time. Interviews with him were the basis of the first published accounts of sewer alligators. However, the story of the 'Sewer Gator' in New York City is well known and various versions have been told.
