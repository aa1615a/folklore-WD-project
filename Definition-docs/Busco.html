			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>Busco, Indiana</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>An enormous snapping turtle estimated to be about 500 pounds. It was named Oscar after the farmer who first spotted it.
				</p>

			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p>The story starts in 1898, when a farmer named Oscar Fulk supposedly saw a giant turtle living in the seven-acre lake on his farm near Churubusco. He told others about it, but eventually he decided to leave it alone.</p>
				<p>A half century later, in July 1948, two Churubusco citizens, Ora Blue and Charley Wilson, also reported seeing a huge turtle while fishing on the same lake, which had come to be known as Fulk Lake. A farmer named Gale Harris, who owned the land at that time also reported seeing the creature. Word spread quickly.

				<h4>The month long search</h4>
					<p>In early 1949, a UPI reporter from Fort Wayne sent the story out on the wire services. The turtle became nationally famous and sparked a month search to find the creature. Curious mobs of sightseers began to invade Harrisâ€™ land. Traffic got so bad that the state police had to be called in for traffic control. Eventually, people questioned the existence of the turtle.
					</p>

				<h4>Capturing Attempts</h4>
					<p>To vindicate his good name, Harris made several attempts to catch the beast, including draining the lake by pumping the water into an area sealed off by a dam with the help of Orville Bright and Kenneth Leitch only for the dam to break when the lake had almost been entirely drained. But despite many attempts, "Oscar" was never captured.</p>

					<p>In March 1949, an attempt to send a deep-sea diver into the pond failed when the wrong equipment was delivered to the Harris farm.</p>
					<p>A photographer for Life Magazine, Mike Shea, took 299 photos at the site, but they were deemed unusable. However, dozens of photos related to the history of the Beast are archived for viewing on the Web site of the Indianapolis Star</p>
