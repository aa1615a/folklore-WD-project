			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>This legendary animal is said to roam the wilds of Mexico, the southwestern US and Puerto Rico, and is blamed for livestock deaths and missing children.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>Physical descriptions of the creature vary. Some descriptions state that it is a relativley heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail. Other stay it is like a hyena or coyote. It drains its victims of blood and leaves strange, deep wounds around the throat area</p>

				<h4>Etymology</h4>
					<p>The name "Chupacabra" literally means "goat-sucker" in spanish; from chupar, "to suck", and cabra, "goat".</p>

					<p>Puerto Rican comedian and entrepreneur Silverio Pérez is credited with coining the term chupacabras soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in many Latin countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Argentina, as well as in the United States, and Mexico.</p>

			<h3>Legend</h3>
				<p> The first reported attack occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico. Eight sheep were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood. A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of Canóvanas, when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed. By the end of the year the mysterious beast had been blamed for over 1000. In 1975, similar killings in the small town of Moca were attributed to El Vampiro de Moca ("The Vampire of Moca").</p>

				<p>Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a Satanic cult; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.</p>

				<h4>Sightings</h4>
					<p>Eyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and as far south as Chile, and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and the Philippines, but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as canids afflicted by mange. According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an urban legend.</p>
